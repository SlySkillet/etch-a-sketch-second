# etch-a-sketch-second

second try at etch-a-sketch to make sure I understand the process

I'm going to try to get this to work without referring to the video that helped me through it on the last go round. This was a challenging project and I'm not sure I have my head fully wrapped around these concepts.

This is a replication of the game Etch-A-Sketch!

The user clicks on a grid area to begin drawing in three different modes: black, greyscale, rainbow, or eraser. User can determine the size of the grid using a scale bar (between 16x16 and 100x100). A clear button resets the grid.
